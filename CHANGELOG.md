# 0.7.0 -- 2020-09-07

- **Breaking changes**: the macro approach provided in 0.6.x and lower has been entirely removed. It was hard to maintain and limited maintenance of the tests themselves.
- A new builder approach has been implemented.
- Support for asynchronous tests has been implemented -- this is runtime agnostic.
